Quick Reference Guides
======================

The BV-BRC website resource provides an entry point to integrated data and tools for viral and bacterial infectious disease research. The website is organized by data types and analysis tools. These **Quick Reference Guides** provide summary information for each of the components of the website, including information on what the component is, what it does, where it is located, and an overview of its features.

-  `Organisms <organisms_menu.html>`_ - links to bacterial and viral data sorted into genera and families, respectively. On each organism page, further divisions into data types are available from the data tabs such as Overview, Taxonomy, Phylogeny, Genome/Strain List, Gene/Features, Protein Families, Protein Structures, etc.

-  `Searches <searches_menu.html>`_ - links to specialized advanced searches across the various data types in BV-BRC.

-  `Services and Tools <services_menu.html>`_ - links to data processing and analysis pipelines in BV-BRC. Currently, services are available for processing user-supplied data including Genome Assembly, Genome Annotation, BLAST, Variation Analysis, RNA-Seq Analysis, Protein Family Comparison, Proteome Comparison, Pathway Comparison, and others. 

-  `Workspace, Private Data, Groups, Jobs <workspace_groups_upload.html>`_ - links to the private workspace and subdirectories in the private workspace; service jobs; and private genomes.

-  `Help <help_menu.html>`_ - links to documentaion pages containing Quick Reference Guides, Tutorials, Webinars, and information to Provide Feedback.

-  `About <about_menu.html>`_ - links to pages containing additional information such as About BV-BRC, Contact Us, Our Team, Announcements, Outreach, Publications, Citations, Related Resources, and the BV-BRC GitHub code repository.
