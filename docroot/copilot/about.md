## 1  What is BV-BRC Copilot?

BV-BRC Copilot is an AI-powered, context-aware chatbot built into the BV-BRC website. It answers questions about **how to use BV-BRC** and **what each tool, data type, or result means**—all without leaving your browser tab.

## 2  Opening Copilot

| Where you are                 | How to open                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Any BV-BRC page               | Click the **Chat** icon in the lower-right corner     |
| Data grids or the Job Manager | Click the green **Chat** bar directly above the table |

Copilot is available to anyone who is logged in with a valid BV-BRC account.

## 3  What Copilot Can Help You With *Today*

| Topic                  | Example questions you can ask                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Finding features       | “Where do I upload FASTQ files?”               |
| Explaining services    | “What does the Genome Assembly Service do?”    |
| Interpreting results   | “What does ‘N50’ mean in my assembly report?”  |
| Job Manager basics     | “How do I view the log for a completed job?”   |
| Page-specific guidance | “What do the columns in this table represent?” |

Copilot **does not** run analyses, change your data, or modify jobs—its role is to explain *how*.

## 4  Using the **Include Screenshot** Button

Inside the chat window you’ll see **Include Screenshot** (camera icon). When enabled, Copilot automatically attaches a snapshot of the page *behind* the chat window (the chat itself is hidden). This lets Copilot “see” the table, form, or report you’re asking about—especially handy for:

* Troubleshooting column options in large data grids
* Asking “What does this error panel mean?”
* Getting help interpreting a result file that is open in the browser viewer

> **Privacy note:** Copilot still cannot read private workspace files directly; it only sees what’s visible in the screenshot.

## 5  Best Practices for Great Answers

1. **Be specific** – mention the page or tool you’re viewing.
2. **Use complete sentences** – full questions give the best context.
3. **One task at a time** – break complex requests into separate chats.
4. **Attach a screenshot** – turn on **Include Screenshot** when visual context matters.
5. **Check citations** – Copilot cites the docs it used so you can verify the info.

## 6  Troubleshooting & Issue Reporting

If Copilot fails to answer or behaves oddly:

1. Click **Report Issue** (top of the chat window).
2. Describe what happened; screenshots are optional but helpful.
3. Submit—our team reviews reports daily to improve Copilot’s responses.

---

## 7  Known Limitations

* Copilot cannot launch, cancel, or clone jobs (yet).
* Very long or highly technical prompts may exceed context limits—try shorter questions.
* Private workspace data is *not* read directly; rely on screenshots for file-content questions.

## 8  Roadmap (All items — status TBD)

| Planned feature                      | What it will do                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| In-chat job submission               | Launch analyses directly from Copilot       |
| Workspace file summaries             | Let Copilot describe your private files     |
| Personalized “next-step” suggestions | Recommend analyses based on recent activity |

Your feedback via **Report Issue** directly shapes this roadmap.
