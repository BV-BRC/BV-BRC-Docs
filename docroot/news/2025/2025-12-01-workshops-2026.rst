   :alt: BV-BRC May Workshop

The BV-BRC (Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center) team is excited to announce two upcoming Bioinformatics Workshops in 2025. Each workshop will show researchers how to analyze and explore bacterial and viral pathogen data using the BV-BRC website and command-line tools, with hands-on examples across bacterial and viral workflows.

Both workshops include two separate components—a bacterial track and a viral track—and participants may register for one or both. Each event also includes time for command-line training and opportunities to try out our AI Copilot.

Registration fills up quickly—register now to attend one of these workshops!

2. **Does my registration confirm my participation?**  
   No. Once you apply, we will confirm your attendance by email.

3. **Do I need prior bioinformatics experience?**  
   No prior experience is required.

4. **Will I need to bring my own computer?**  
   Yes, please bring your own laptop.

5. **Are hotel room blocks available?**  
   Room block information is being finalized. This page will be updated once confirmed.

6. **Do I need to bring my own data?**  
   No; all workshop examples use publicly available datasets.  
   However, if you have questions about your own data, the BV-BRC team can help you explore how to analyze it.

7. **Are scholarships available?**  
   BV-BRC does not offer travel scholarships.  
   However, external opportunities include:
