The BV-BRC Copilot is an AI-powered, context-aware chatbot embedded directly in the BV-BRC website. 
It delivers on-demand guidance for navigating pages, understanding tools and data types, and interpreting results—right from your browser. 
Copilot can optionally receive a live screenshot of the page you’re viewing, letting it answer page-specific questions with greater accuracy. 
This feature is currently in beta, and your feedback will help us refine Copilot’s capabilities and expand what it can do.
