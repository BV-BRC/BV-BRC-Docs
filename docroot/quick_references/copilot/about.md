## 1  What is BV-BRC Copilot?

BV‑BRC Copilot is an AI‑powered chat assistant embedded throughout the BV‑BRC website. It is designed to serve both as a virtual helpdesk—guiding users through data, tools, analysis services, and job results in real time—and as a knowledge hub that can explain broader biology and bioinformatics concepts without leaving the site. Copilot can optionally use a live screenshot of the page you are viewing to answer page‑specific questions with greater accuracy.

The BV‑BRC Copilot is currently in beta. Your feedback will help us continually refine and enhance its capabilities.

## 3  What Copilot Can Help You With *Today*

| Use case                  | Ask Copilot to…                                                                  | Typical examples                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Virtual Helpdesk**      | Explain any BV‑BRC page, data, tool, service, or job.                            | • “How to I analyze my bacteriual genome?”<br> • "How do I use genome annotation service?"<br> • “Explain the table and filters on current page."<br> • "why did my job fail? |
| **Virtual Knowledge Hub** | Summarize biology or bioinformatics concepts using its built‑in model knowledge. | • "Describe this organism and its relevance to public health."<br> •  “What is an N50?”<br> • “How does average nucleotide identity work?”                          |

Copilot **does not** run analyses, change your data, or modify jobs — its role is to explain *how*.

## 4  Using the **Include Screenshot** Button

Inside the chat window you’ll see **Include Screenshot** (camera icon). When enabled, Copilot automatically attaches a snapshot of the page *behind* the chat window (the chat itself is hidden). This lets Copilot “see” the table, form, or report you’re asking about—especially handy for:

* Troubleshooting column options in large data grids
* Asking “What does this error panel mean?”
* Getting help interpreting a result file that is open in the browser viewer

> **Privacy note:** Copilot still cannot read private workspace files directly; it only sees what’s visible in the screenshot.

## 5  Best Practices for Great Answers

1. **Be specific** – mention the page or tool you’re viewing.
2. **Use complete sentences** – full questions give the best context.
3. **One task at a time** – break complex requests into separate chats.
4. **Attach a screenshot** – turn on **Include Screenshot** when visual context matters.
5. **Check citations** – Copilot cites the docs it used so you can verify the info.

## 6  Troubleshooting & Issue Reporting

If Copilot fails to answer or behaves oddly:

1. Click **Report Issue** (top of the chat window).
2. Describe what happened; screenshots are optional but helpful.
3. Submit—our team reviews reports daily to improve Copilot’s responses.

## 7  Known Limitations

* Copilot cannot launch, cancel, or rerun failed jobs (yet).
* Very long or highly technical prompts may exceed context limits—try shorter questions.
* Private workspace data is *not* read directly; rely on screenshots for file-content questions.
