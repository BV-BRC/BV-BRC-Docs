Pathways
========

BV-BRC bacterial data is linked to associated biochemical pathways

Our analysis tools and interactive visualizations allow users to highlight regions of genome loss or conservation and ultimately look for changes within the context of functional pathways. Pathways of interest can be identified using the `Comparative Pathway Tool <https://alpha.bv-brc.org/app/ComparativePathway>`_ and then analyzed individually, or in selected sets, via the Comparative Pathway Heatmap and KEGG Map.
