SARS-CoV-2 Emerging Variant Reports
====================================

The BV-BRC SARS-CoV-2 Emerging Variant Reports provide weekly summaries of the sequence prevalence and growth statistics for the SARS-CoV-2 lineages, covariants and spike protein mutations based on the sequence data from GISAID. The report is available as a downloadable Excel file as well as an Executive Summary Report, which highlights notable variants for the week and their prevalence and growth characteristics. 
 
Please note  that the information provided reflects sequence counts and sequence proportions and, as such, is impacted by sampling bias in the sequence databases and should not be interpreted as the true prevalence of disease caused by these variants.
 
In addition, due to sequence anomalies (e.g., ambiguous nucleotides in many sequence records) and other issues, the absolute counts of Variants of Concern sequences are likely to be underestimation of the true sequence prevalence. 
 
The reports includes preliminary/incomplete stats for the current month in order to help identify early signs of novel
