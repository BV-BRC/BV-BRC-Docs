BV‑BRC Copilot is an AI‑powered chat assistant embedded throughout the BV‑BRC website and accessible via the speech‑bubble icon in the bottom‑right corner. It is designed to serve both as a virtual helpdesk — guiding users through data, tools, analysis services, and job results in real-time — and as a knowledge hub that can explain broader biology and bioinformatics concepts without leaving the site. Copilot can optionally use a live screenshot of the page you are viewing to answer page‑specific questions with greater accuracy.

The BV‑BRC Copilot is currently in beta. Your feedback will help us continually refine and enhance its capabilities.
