The BV-BRC (Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center) team will be offering a **Bioinformatics Workshop on February 24-28, 2025, at Argonne National Laboratory** in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. The workshop will show researchers how to analyze and explore **bacterial and viral pathogen data** using the BV-BRC website, focusing on bacterial, and viral examples and workflows.

This workshop will have two separate components, and researchers can register for one or both. The bacterial component, concentrating on analyzing antimicrobial resistance data, will take place on Monday, February 24th to mid-day on Wednesday, February 26th. The viral component will begin Wednesday, February 26th and concludes on Friday, February 28th. 

**Researchers can sign up for one or both of these sessions and must state their preference(s) when they register (see Registration below).**

The workshop will consist of interactive hands-on training sessions. During Days 1-2 (February 24-25) the workshop will concentrate on exploring and analyzing bacterial antimicrobial resistance data.  Participants will learn how to search for public datasets of interest and perform genomic, comparative genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic analyses using various analysis services and tools at BV-BRC. 
The morning session of Day 3 (February 26) will focus on using the BV-BRC command-line interface for programmatic search and retrieval of data and submission of analysis jobs. Users will also have the opportunity to work with their own data and analysis problems with assistance from the BV-BRC team members.  

The viral component begins on the afternoon of Day 3 (February 26), concentrating on searching for data performing phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses.  Day 4 (February 27) focuses on sequence assembly and annotation, subspecies classification, protein structure, surveillance data exploration, sequence feature variant data and transcriptomic analysis. Day 5 (February 28) includes the docking service, and hands-on exercises.
