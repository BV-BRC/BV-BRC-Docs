Accelerating FAIR Data and Tools with AI
----------------------------------------
The NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) invite researchers, data scientists, and developers to apply for a three-day AI Codeathon focused on improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability (FAIR-ness) of BRC data and tools using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs).
This event will bring together participants from diverse backgrounds to build prototypes that lower the learning barrier for new users, streamline data integration, and accelerate infectious disease science.
